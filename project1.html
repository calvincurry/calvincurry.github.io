  <p><h1>Project 1: Project Management</h1>
    <h4>Build a website to post documentation of work done for Introduction to Digital Fabrication.
      Become familiar with web design tools, and gain exposure to common workflows in this field. 
    </h4>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>Setting Up</h2>
    Before building the website itself, first I had to make sure that all the tools necessary for building a website were in order.
    Specifically, I needed somewhere to host the site, an editor to make changes to the website code, and a way to push changes I made
    in my editor onto the hosting service. <br/>

    For this course, we are using Github pages to host our website. GitHub pages hosts websites with small file sizes and bandwidth needs
    for free, and allows easy access to the repository where the website is stored to update the code. To push changes to the online 
    repository, we used git. Because I am on a Windows PC, I first downloaded gitbash, a client for inputting git commands. From the client, 
    I was able to clone the online repository to my local storage, and then use git commit and git push commands to upload any changes I 
    made to my online repository.<br/>

    Finally, with a quick way to push new versions of the website, I needed to set up an editor to write HTML code for the website. I chose 
    to use VSCode, and installed an extension called 'Live Server,' which would allow me to see changes to the website locally and
    in real-time. With everything set up, it was time to start building the website itself. <br/>

    <h2>CSS Templates</h2>
    Given the limied time we had to complete this first project, I chose to use a CSS template, rather than code a website from scratch
    myself. While I had a very basic understanding of HTML code before beginning this project, I am unfamilliar with using JavaScript for 
    web design, and a pre-defined template would reduce the time I needed to spend on finnicky aesthetic details. For my template, I chose
    the 'Food Blog' CSS template, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp">available for free thanks to w3schools.</a> 
    This template has space for several links/images front and center on the home page. Because the vast majority of the content on this
    website will be devoted to documentation for week-to-week projects, I figured they deserved the primary focus in the layout. The template
    also comes with a sidebar, giving users multiple ways to navigate the site. <br/>

    <h2>Building the Site</h2>
    I first read through the template to find the blocks of code corresponding to each element of the site, and to get a basic idea of
    how all of it functioned. From here, I began to tweak parts of the layout I intended to use, and deleted a couple that I thought were 
    unnecessary. I expanded the sidebar to include a link for every project, then played around with the panels on the home page until I 
    found a layout I was happy with. This was done as much by using Ctrl + f in the w3schools stylesheet to look for used and unused 
    classes, as it was by writing blocks of code myself. I ended up removing pagination from the homepage entirely, so all 10 projects 
    are visible as soon as users open the site. I added links to the panel for every project, so that the project pages could be reached 
    from the panels on the home page, or from the sidebar. <br/>

    The biggest roadblock I ran in to was the use of scripting to make the sidebar and footer content appear on every page, and have changes to
    these elements automatically update across all pages. Without server side permissions, this has to be done using a JavaScript function.
    Given my lack of experience with JavaScript, I was unable to make the function work how I wanted, and updated each page by hand after
    I was satisfied with the sidebar and footer. Outside of my scripting woes, this project helped me better understand CSS code, and how
    to use git to push new versions of a project to a remote repository. This was my first time using git and git commands, but is is clear
    that this workflow could be very beneficial in a collaborative project. <br/>

    I hope to do a bit more editing of the site going forward, (adding images, here and on the home page!) but I am out of time
    for this week.
